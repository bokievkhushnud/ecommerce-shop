  "Hello. My name is Irina, 35 years old. I have a degree in Law and for about 10 years I have worked as a lawyer. My decision to start a career as a Frontend developer came as a realization of my dream to become a programmer. After briefly exploring four different programming languages, I found that I preferred JavaScript the most. Through self-study and the RS School course, I've built my technical stack, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and various libraries and frameworks like SASS, Bootstrap, Material UI, ReactJS, Webpack, Typescript, and basic NodeJS. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and cycling. I thrive as part of a team and firmly believe that continual learning and skill upgrades are essential for any developer.",
  "I am Khushnud Boqiev, a 23-year-old recent Computer Science graduate from UCA. I have a strong passion for Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and the exciting realm of competitive programming. My technical toolkit includes proficiency in JS, Python, Java, TS, Django, and WordPress. Beyond my technical endeavors, I am a fervent football fan, an adept guitar player, and deeply cherish music. My strengths aren't just confined to the digital world; I pride myself on being an effective problem solver, a committed team player, and a genuinely sociable individual.",
  "Hi, I'm Yulia, 26 years old. I have an architectural degree and work as a BIM specialist. I help architects create 3D models of buildings, teach them to use of modeling software, check and automate processes. I'm passionate about technologies and coding. In my free time, I enjoy drawing, traveling, exploring history and fashion. Now, I'm glad to be a student at RS School; it has helped me learn new programming skills and connect with mentors and my super team, Irina and Khushnud.",
